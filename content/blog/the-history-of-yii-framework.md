Yii is one of the long-living PHP frameworks out there constantly evolving with time
as PHP is enhanced more and more. It's interesting to know how it was made.  

## Prado

In June 2004 Qiang Xue released first version of PRADO framework. He was inspired
by Apache Tapestry, Borland Delphi and Microsoft ASP.NET.

Roughly at the same time Zend conducted a competition called "gophp5" to promote
just released PHP 5.0. Qiang re-implemented framework on PHP 5 and won the
competition.

At the time project was hosted at SourceForge. In the middle of 2005 Wei Zhuo helped
with i18n and l10n. Prado 2.0 was released.

In May 2005 it was decided to re-write framework again to include new cool features
inspired by Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0. In April 2006 version 3.0 was released. Starting
from it Prado team mostly on code quality and stability.

PRADO is still alive and used.

## Yii

In October 2006 Qiang announced alpha version of Yii at PRADO forums.

December 3rd 2008 version 1.0.0 was out. Many ideas and some code were taken
from PRADO: ActiveRecord, i18n, l10n etc. More inspiration was from
RoR (convention over configuration, some AR features), symfony1 (filters,
plugins) and Joomla (modules, message translation).

Yii 1.0.0 was significantly faster than other frameworks with alike functionality
so community grew fast.

In January 2010 Yii 1.1 was out. It had form builder, relational queries in AR,
ready to use unit-testing framework and more.

I've joined Yii team in 2010. By the end of the year we were discussing Yii 1.2
while developing version 1.1. In may 2011 it was decided to use newer PHP versions
and fix architectural mistakes i.e. to do 2.0. First commit was made into then
secret repository.

In May 2013 Yii 2.0 code was presented to public. In October 2014 first stable release
was out.
