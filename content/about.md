I'm Alex, one of the core maintainers of [Yii PHP framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/)
for more than 7 years, its representative in [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/),
[active conference speaker](http://slides.rmcreative.ru/) and [participant of various other
OpenSource projects](https://github.com/samdark/).

I am [blogging in Russian since 2005](http://rmcreative.ru/) and now decided
that it is time to write in English as well.

## Seeking for patronage

I am [seeking for patronage](https://www.patreon.com/samdark) in order to work on Yii framework and other OpenSource software.
Would really appreciate if you will support me.
