I'm Alex, one of the core maintainers of [Yii PHP framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/)
for more than 7 years, its representative in [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/),
[active conference speaker](http://slides.rmcreative.ru/) and [participant of various other
OpenSource projects](https://github.com/samdark/).

I am [blogging in Russian since 2005](http://rmcreative.ru/) and now decided
that it is time to write in English as well.

## Seeking for patronage

I was always [doing OpenSource](https://github.com/samdark) in my free time. I was lucky with companies
allowing me that. It was excellent experience but everything changes and time came to move forward.

I've already got some fulltime job offers. These are good and would allow me to back my family well
but taking any of these would mean that I'll spend less time maintaining Yii or doing OpenSource.
Considering the fact that Yii is used by many excellent commercial products and companies and
having me working on Yii fulltime has benefits for these companies I'm seeking for patronage
in form of constant monthly income. My goal is to get a monthly income of the same level as what
I can get by taking a fulltime job.

Pros for a company taking care about patronage:

- I'll spend even more time on Yii framework and other OpenSource enhancing foundation for
  products company builds.
- I can prioritize working on issues in Yii or any of my code you have problems with.
  It doesn't guarantee solving them or accepting proposals but I'll try to solve these in
  the best way possible.
- I can offer bonus Yii-related consulting but for very limited hours to save time for
  the framework itself.
- I can review practices and tools used in your company and suggest improvements.
- I can put together a website listing patrons so it would be beneficial for companies reputation
  among developers.
- Any other ideas could be discussed.
