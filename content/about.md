for more than 7 years, its representative in [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/),
[active conference speaker](http://slides.rmcreative.ru/) and [participant of various other
OpenSource projects](https://github.com/samdark/).

I am [blogging in Russian since 2005](http://rmcreative.ru/) and recently decided
that it is time to write in English as well.
