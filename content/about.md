I'm Alex, an engineer having fun building both OpenSource and commercial systems.
I'm currently part of [Yii framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) core team and
[PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/).

I am [blogging in Russian since 2005](http://rmcreative.ru/) and now decided
that it is time to write in English as well.
